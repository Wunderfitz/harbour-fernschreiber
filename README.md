## Build
Simply clone this repository and ensure to have all [submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) imported as well (e.g. by using `git submodule update --init`). Then use the project file `harbour-fernschreiber.pro` to import the sources in your SailfishOS IDE. To build and run Fernschreiber or an application which is based on Fernschreiber, you need to create the file `harbour-fernschreiber/src/tdlibsecrets.h` and enter the required constants in the following format:

```
#ifndef TDLIBSECRETS_H
#define TDLIBSECRETS_H
const char TDLIB_API_ID[] = "42424242";
const char TDLIB_API_HASH[] = "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef";
#endif // TDLIBSECRETS_H
```

You get the Telegram API ID and hash as soon as you've registered your own application on [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).

Moreover, you need to have a compiled version of [TDLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td) in the sub-directory `tdlib`. This sub-directory must contain another sub-directory that fits to the target device architecture (e.g. armv7hl, i486). Within this directory, there needs to be a folder called `lib` that contains at least `libtdjson.so`. For armv7hl the relative path would consequently be `tdlib/armv7hl/lib`.

## Debug
Fernschreiber does only output a few TDLib messages by default. To get its own debug log messages, you can either run a debug build to see all of them or use the environment variable `QT_LOGGING_RULES` to specify/filter which messages you'd like to see.

Run `QT_LOGGING_RULES="fernschreiber.*=true" harbour-fernschreiber` to see all messages or replace the `*` with specific logging categories. You'll find the logging category inside the corresponding `.cpp` file for backend usage or you can use `JS` to only see frontend messages.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute bug fixes, improvements, new features etc. please create a pull request (PR). PRs are always welcome and will be reviewed as soon as possible, but may take some time. :)
