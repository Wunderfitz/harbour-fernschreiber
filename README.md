## Build
Simply clone this repository and ensure to have all [submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) imported as well (e.g. by using `git submodule update --init`). Then use the project file `harbour-fernschreiber.pro` to import the sources in your SailfishOS IDE. To build and run Fernschreiber or an application which is based on Fernschreiber, you need to create the file `harbour-fernschreiber/src/tdlibsecrets.h` and enter the required constants in the following format:

```
#ifndef TDLIBSECRETS_H
#define TDLIBSECRETS_H
const char TDLIB_API_ID[] = "42424242";
const char TDLIB_API_HASH[] = "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef";
#endif // TDLIBSECRETS_H
```

You get the Telegram API ID and hash as soon as you've registered your own application on [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).

Moreover, you need to have a compiled version of [TDLib 1.7](https://github.com/tdlib/td) in the sub-directory `tdlib`. This sub-directory must contain another sub-directory that fits to the target device architecture (e.g. armv7hl, i486). Within this directory, there needs to be a folder called `lib` that contains at least `libtdjson.so`. For armv7hl the relative path would consequently be `tdlib/armv7hl/lib`.

In case you encounter strange performance issues on startup (several seconds delay, app seems to do nothing), please be sure to [follow the instructions from the respective GitHub issue](https://github.com/tdlib/td/issues/1322), i.e. let TDLib build SQLite with `-DOMIT_MEMLOCK` and be sure to comment the two lines 22558 (`#ifndef OMIT_MEMLOCK`) and 22567 (`#endif`) in the file `sqlite/sqlite/sqlite3.c`.

Moreover, TDLib 1.7 has issues loading some pinned messages in case the message database is used (which is the case in Fernschreiber). [A small patch](https://github.com/tdlib/td/commit/30d912bd4b145afb8d494b307d37645ffa21ec29) is required to make TDLib work properly in all cases. See [the respective TDLib issue](https://github.com/tdlib/td/issues/1343) for more details.

In case you want to use the same codebase which was used to compile the library that is shipped with Fernschreiber, please [check out the fork](https://github.com/Wunderfitz/td), be sure to use the branch `fernschreiber` and compile these sources using the following commands (be sure to have the Sailfish OS build engine running):

- `alias sfdk=~/SailfishOS/bin/sfdk`
- `sfdk config target=SailfishOS-3.3.0.16-armv7hl` (this compiles the sources on SFOS 3.3 and ARM - the target needs to be adjusted according to the running SDK engine and the platform)
- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `sfdk build-shell cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=../tdlib -DTD_ENABLE_LTO=ON ..` (in case of compilation issues, try removing the flag `-DTD_ENABLE_LTO=ON`)
- `sfdk build-shell cmake --build . --target install`

You'll find the compiled library in the directory `td/tdlib`.


## Debug
Fernschreiber does only output a few TDLib messages by default. To get its own debug log messages, you can either run a debug build to see all of them or use the environment variable `QT_LOGGING_RULES` to specify/filter which messages you'd like to see.

Run `QT_LOGGING_RULES="fernschreiber.*=true" harbour-fernschreiber` to see all messages or replace the `*` with specific logging categories. You'll find the logging category inside the corresponding `.cpp` file for backend usage or you can use `JS` to only see frontend messages.
